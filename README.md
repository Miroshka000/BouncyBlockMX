# BouncyBlocksMX
BouncyBlocksMX is a plugin for Minecraft servers based on Nukkit that adds a unique physical feature to blocks in the Minecraft world. With this plugin, certain blocks can give players an extra boost when they jump or step on them, making movement across the map more dynamic and interesting.
Key Features:
